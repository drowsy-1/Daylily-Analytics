## The Problem

With 100 years of intensive hybridization resulting in over 102,000 registered daylily varieties, collectors and hybridizers face an overwhelming selection challenge. Current breeding strategies range from:

- **Award-focused**: Selecting only award-winning varieties as parents
- **Trait-specific**: Choosing varieties with specific desired characteristics  
- **Performance-based**: Intensive screening for growth habit, disease, and pest resistance
- **Opportunistic**: Crossing available "pretty flowers" hoping for the best

**The Gap**: No data-driven techniques exist beyond simple filtering, leaving significant potential for improving breeding outcomes through statistical analysis and network-based insights.

**The Solution**: This project provides the first comprehensive data-driven analysis of daylily breeding patterns, offering actionable insights for both novice and experienced hybridizers.

## Data Acquisition & Challenges

### Data Source
- **Primary**: American Daylily Society database (https://daylilies.org/)
- **Scale**: 101,718 unique varieties spanning 1763-2025
- **Completeness**: Varies by field (100% for core data, 1.07% for specialized traits)

### Technical Approach
Due to database access limitations, I developed a custom web scraping solution:
- **Methodology**: Iterative scraping using Python requests module
- **Ethics**: Nighttime execution (off-peak), 10 entries per request, proxy rotation
- **Scope**: 3-4 nights for text data, 3 nights for images (~4GB)
- **Output**: Clean, consistent dataset ready for analysis
